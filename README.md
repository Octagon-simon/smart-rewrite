# SmartRewrite - AI-Powered Text Rewriting Chrome Extension

SmartRewrite is a Chrome extension that uses AI to instantly rewrite selected text on any webpage, making it sound more professional and polished. Perfect for emails, documents, social media posts, and any text that needs a professional touch.

> This currently works on freshdesk domains because I work with a company (Afriex) where I need to sound more professional in my emails and it gave me the inspo to build this extension.

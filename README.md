# SmartRewrite - AI-Powered Text Rewriting Chrome Extension

SmartRewrite is a Chrome extension that uses AI to instantly rewrite selected text on any webpage, making it sound more professional and polished. Perfect for emails, documents, social media posts, and any text that needs a professional touch.

> This currently works on freshdesk domains because I work with a company (Afriex) where I need to sound more professional in my emails and it gave me the inspo to build this extension.

### Option 1: Use Deployed Backend (Recommended)

The extension is configured to use a deployed Vercel backend with Grok AI integration.

### Option 2: Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**
   
   https://github.com/Octagon-simon/smart-rewrite-backend


2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
    npm install
   ```
   
3. **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file:
   ```bash
    XAI_API_KEY=your_xai_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
    npm start
   ```

5. **Update extension:** Change the API URL in `background.js` to `http://localhost:5000`

### Option 3: Deploy to Vercel

1. **Push to GitHub** and connect to Vercel
2. **Add environment variable** `XAI_API_KEY` in Vercel project settings or add the xAI grok integration to your vercel account for automatic api key provision.
